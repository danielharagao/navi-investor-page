            <h2>OpenAI / ChatGPT (GPT family)</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>ChatGPT web + API, GPT models, and the extensible "GPTs"/plugin ecosystem. OpenAI also experiments with agent-like features (tool use, Actions, and developer agent patterns).</p>

                <h3>Browser/agent capabilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plugins and Tools enable third-party integrations (including browsing, web search, and custom APIs).</li>
                    <li>Actions allow developers to build custom integrations for web automation.</li>
                    <li>Can orchestrate web tasks via plugins or developer-built agents (e.g., browsing, form submission) but requires connectors.</li>
                    <li>Desktop apps available for macOS, Windows.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top-tier LLMs, large ecosystem, strong developer APIs, rapid iteration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Out-of-the-box browser automation is not a first-class, packaged experience — needs connectors/plugins.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Official links</h3>
                <ul>

                </ul>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For browser automation use cases, OpenAI + a tool/plugin (or a custom agent harness) is a common approach.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Confirm Manus in-app pricing and API availability by logging into an account or checking the official account/pricing dashboard (some public reporting differs).</li>
                <li>Capture direct links to Claude and ChatGPT download pages if we want to reference desktop client installers in the product research.</li>

            <h2>Browser navigation (classification)</h2>
            <p>For each product below I classify how its browser navigation works: "Extension" = runs inside the user's installed browser as an extension; "Server/container" = navigates web pages in the product's own server-side headless/container browser instances; "Local browser control" = can drive the user's local browser instance (only when deployed with local executors like Playwright); "Web UI / web app" = browsing via a hosted web UI but not necessarily executing multi‑step navigation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perplexity (perplexity.ai):</strong> Server/container + Web UI<br>Navigation runs inside Perplexity's service (server-side browsing, Research/Labs). It's not a browser extension that controls your local browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Manus (manus.im):</strong> Server/container agent<br>Autonomous agent executes tasks in Manus-managed containers/headless browsers (credit-based concurrency). Does not drive your local browser by default.</li>
                <li><strong>ChatGPT / OpenAI (chat.openai.com + Plugins/Actions):</strong> Server-side tools & optionally Extension/Connectors<br>Core browsing and Actions are executed by OpenAI's server-side tools or plugin connectors. To control a local browser you must install a client-side extension or run a local executor (developer integration using Playwright/Puppeteer).</li>
                <li><strong>Anthropic / Claude (claude.com):</strong> Server/container + Extension (Claude for Chrome)<br>Claude agents and connectors perform server-side navigation and research. The official Claude for Chrome extension enables agentic browsing within the user's browser. Desktop apps are UI shells connecting to cloud agents.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto-Agent frameworks (Auto-GPT, AgentGPT):</strong> Local or Server depending on deployment<br>These frameworks are planners; they can control a local browser if run with a local executor (Playwright/Puppeteer) or run headless browsers on servers/containers when hosted. Behavior depends on how the user/deployer configures the executor.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser extensions (Merlin, ChatGPT-for-Google, Claude extensions):</strong> Extension (in-browser)<br>These run inside the user's browser context and can read the DOM, inject content, fill fields, and interact with pages the user has open. They require extension permissions and do not spawn remote browser sessions by default.</li>

                <li>For each high-priority competitor (OpenAI, Perplexity, Claude, Auto-Agent projects): produce a one-page SWOT and link repository of official docs and pricing.</li>
