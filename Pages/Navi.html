      <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
      <p>You know how ChatGPT can help you think and write, but can't actually go do things for you? Navi does the doing: for managers and entrepreneurs who lose hours to repetitive and ad-hoc browser-based tasks, Navi runs as a desktop application that opens its own Google Chrome instance and performs actions on the browser just like you or your assistant would do. It can log-in to CRM, ERP, social media, or execute any action on any web app or website. You can ask Navi to do one-off ad-hoc tasks or schedule routines to run automatically. Navi gives you immediate massive time savings, fewer manual errors, and near-infinite productivity.</p>
      
      <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
      <p>You're drowning in emails, permissions, reports, and all the little digital tasks that add up to hours every day. You want to focus on the big picture, but instead, you're stuck sharing files, granting access, pulling data, and handling all the busywork.</p>
    <h3>Pain Points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited AI web interaction: Traditional AI assistants can't directly browse the web, requiring manual intervention for online tasks.</li>
      <li>Fragmented tool integration: Connecting AI with web automation tools involves complex setups and fragmented workflows.</li>
      <li>Conversation context loss: Many AI systems fail to maintain chat history for truly personalized, context-aware responses.</li>
      <li>Manual web automation: Repetitive tasks like form filling, data scraping, and web navigation are time-consuming and prone to errors.</li>
      <li>Scalable AI collaboration: Building systems for complex, collaborative workflows demands extensive technical knowledge.</li>
      <li>Repetitive and ad-hoc browser tasks (report pulling, file sharing, permission changes) that consume hours each week.</li>
      <li>Interrupt-driven context switching: users lose focus switching between systems to complete small tasks.</li>
      <li>People can't do all they want because they can't do it all themselves; there's no one else to do that, so they just can't do more.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Needs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An intelligent conversational assistant with direct web browsing capabilities for executing online tasks autonomously.</li>
      <li>Persistent chat history to maintain context and deliver personalized, coherent responses.</li>
      <li>Seamless integration of AI with web automation tools without requiring complex technical configurations.</li>
      <li>Automated handling of repetitive web-based activities like form filling and data extraction to save time and minimize errors.</li>
      <li>Scalable collaboration features for managing complex workflows through natural language interactions.</li>
      <li>A simple assistant that does the basic browser work for them (logging in, filling forms, pulling reports, clicking through workflows).</li>
      <li>Time freed: users want their repetitive browser chores taken off their plate so they can focus on higher-value work.</li>
      <li>Low effort to start: minimal setup and obvious benefits within the first runs.</li>
      <li>Clear safety: users want to trust the assistant to act safely on their behalf (easy pause/stop and clear consent for risky actions).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
