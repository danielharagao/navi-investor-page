# Navi - Strategic Product Document

## Elevator Pitch
You know how ChatGPT can help you think and write, but can't actually go do things for you? Navi does the doing: for managers and entrepreneurs who lose hours to repetitive and ad-hoc browser-based tasks, Navi runs as a desktop application that opens its own Google Chrome instance and performs actions on the browser just like you or your assistant would do. It can log-in to CRM, ERP, social media, or navigate and execute any action on any web app or website. You can ask Navi to do one-off ad-hoc tasks or schedule routines to run automatically. Navi gives you immediate massive time savings, fewer manual errors, and just allows you to near-infinite productivity.

## The Problem We Solve
You know that feeling when you're drowning in emails, permissions, reports, and all the little digital tasks that add up to hours every day? You want to focus on the big picture, the creative work, the things that actually move you forward. But instead, you're stuck sharing files, granting access, pulling data, and handling all the busywork.

### Pain Points
- Limited AI web interaction: Traditional AI assistants can't directly browse the web, requiring manual intervention for online tasks.
- Fragmented tool integration: Connecting AI with web automation tools involves complex setups and fragmented workflows.
- Conversation context loss: Many AI systems fail to maintain chat history for truly personalized, context-aware responses.
- Manual web automation: Repetitive tasks like form filling, data scraping, and web navigation are time-consuming and prone to errors.
- Scalable AI collaboration: Building systems for complex, collaborative workflows demands extensive technical knowledge.
- Repetitive and ad-hoc browser tasks (report pulling, file sharing, permission changes) that consume hours each week.
- Interrupt-driven context switching: users lose focus switching between systems to complete small tasks.
- People can't do all they want because they can't do it all themselves; there's no one else to do that, so they just can't do more.

### User Needs
- An intelligent conversational assistant with direct web browsing capabilities for executing online tasks autonomously.
- Persistent chat history to maintain context and deliver personalized, coherent responses.
- Seamless integration of AI with web automation tools without requiring complex technical configurations.
- Automated handling of repetitive web-based activities like form filling and data extraction to save time and minimize errors.
- Scalable collaboration features for managing complex workflows through natural language interactions.
- A simple assistant that does the basic browser work for them (logging in, filling forms, pulling reports, clicking through workflows) so they can get more done.
- Time freed: users want their repetitive browser chores taken off their plate so they can focus on higher-value work.
- Low effort to start: minimal setup and obvious benefits within the first runs.
- Clear safety: users want to trust the assistant to act safely on their behalf (easy pause/stop and clear consent for risky actions).

## Our Solution
Navi is like having an assistant who can work for you 24/7. They have their own browser, their own computer—they can literally do anything you need done online. Share that email, give access to that folder, get the information you need, handle all the repetitive tasks that eat up your day.

### How It Works
**Conversational interface with seamless web automation. You chat. Navi acts.**

Simply converse with Navi about what you need:
- "Research the latest trends in AI" → Navi browses multiple websites and summarizes key insights
- "Fill out this online form for me" → Navi navigates to the site and completes the form
- "Find the best deals on laptops" → Navi searches e-commerce sites and compares options
- "Generate a report on customer feedback" → Navi extracts data from various sources and creates content

Navi maintains conversation history for personalized, context-aware interactions and executes web-based tasks autonomously. No complex setups—just natural language requests, and Navi delivers results.

- Day 5–7: deploy the MVP to pilot users for live trials; collect qualitative feedback and financial telemetry; measure early KPIs.

**Success Criteria (Pilot)**:
- Functional: 2 representative flows run successfully in pilot environment with >70% success during live trials in week 1.
- Impact: early indications of time saved (qualitative + target ≥ 2 hours/user/week when scaled).
- Adoption: pilot users can run ad-hoc automations and use chat/continue flow during sessions; target ≥ 60% trial usage during the week.

## Key Metrics & KPIs
**SMART, Aggressive Targets**:
